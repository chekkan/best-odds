#### Other commands:

- `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once

- `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and recompiling when it sees them

- `npm run lite` - runs the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing

- `npm run typings` - runs the typings tool separately

- `npm run postinstall` - called by npm automatically after it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files defined in `typings.json`
